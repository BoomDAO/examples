/**
 * The CanisterStatus utility is used to request structured data directly from the IC public API. This data can be accessed using agent.readState, but CanisterStatus provides a helpful abstraction with some known paths.
 *
 * You can request a canisters Controllers, ModuleHash, Candid interface, Subnet, or Time, or provide a custom path {@link CanisterStatus.CustomPath} and pass arbitrary buffers for valid paths identified in https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec.
 *
 * The primary method for this namespace is {@link CanisterStatus.request}
